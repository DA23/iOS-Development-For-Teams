# Provisioning Profiles

A provisioning profile links together certificates, devices and App IDs. They are disposable, downloadable via the Dev centre and do not require backing up. Provisioning profiles can be regenerated by any developer at any time since restoring them simply requires downloading and opening (assuming you have a valid certificate).

We recommend that when creating provisioning profiles that all certificates and devices are included.

There should be one provisioning profile per app, per environment.

## Create a shared Development Provisioning Profile

- Go to the [iOS Dev Centre - Provisioning Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/profile/profileList.action)

- Click add and select **iOS App Development** then continue.

- Select your wildcard App ID (you may need to set this up first by following [this guide](/guide/app_id/readme.md)) then continue.

- **Select all certificates and all devices.**

  > The reason for selecting all certificates and devices is that it will reduce the frequency of this certificate being regenerated. This also means all computers with a certificate are ready to develop on any app.

- Finally download the Profile and open the file, this will either open in Keychain Access or iPhone Configuration Utility depending on what version of OSX you use. If opened in iPhone Configuration Utility you will prompted to confirm you wish to add this profile to your library.

## Restore the Development Provisioning Profile

- Go to the [iOS Dev Centre - Provisioning Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/profile/profileList.action)

- Click on the profile with the name `Development`

- Click Edit

- **If your certificate is checked and your target device is check then press cancel otherwise select All certificates and All devices.**

  > The reason for selecting all certificates and devices is that it will reduce the frequency of this certificate being regenerated. This also means all computers with a certificate are ready to develop on any app.

- Finally download the Profile and open the file, this will either open in Keychain Access or iPhone Configuration Utility depending on what version of OSX you use. If opened in iPhone Configuration Utility you will prompted to confirm you wish to add this profile to your library.
